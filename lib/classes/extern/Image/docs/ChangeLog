Version 0.5.0-alpha [2005-Aug-08] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
    * Major change: removed Image_Graph_Driver and subclasses and uses Image_Canvas instead, which implies:
        - Image_Graph_Color is obsolete, removing dependency on Image_Color (however Image_Canvas still depends on Image_Color)
        - Fonts are simplified (all identified by name) and implemented using Image_Graph_Font class, removing Image_Graph_Font subclasses (only subclasses!), removing Fonts/ folder
        - Added dependency on Image_Canvas
        - Image/Graph/Config.php becoming obsolete since only IMAGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_FONT_PATH was defined here. File kept for future purposes but not used.
        - TTF Fonts (which were most often used) keep BC in 99% of the cases by replacing the 'ttf_font' factory alias mapping to 'Image_Graph_Font' and adding a mapping for 'Image_Graph_Font_TTF' to 'Image_Graph_Font'. Only case not working is when user manually includes Image/Graph/Font/TTF.php and creates and instance using 'new', which should only very, very rarely be the case
        - BC break: If drivers were explicitly created before, they now have to be changed to Image_Canvas objects
    * Added support for HTML image maps on line-, bar-, area-, smoothed line-, impulse-, band- and pie charts (more to come)
    * Added 'tohtml' option for output directly in HTML using canvas and imagemap (if any)
    * Added label option 'format' and 'dateformat' to Image_Graph_Axis to be able to format a label directly using sprintf() / date()
    * Changed plus and cross markers to be outlined (by defalut) - visual improvement
    * Added a star marker (Image_Graph_Marker_Star)
    * Added legends to scatter/dot plots - the marker now shows in legends
    * Performance optimization in Image_Graph_Axis_Category (with regards to heavy usage of array_search())
    * Improved appearance of axis arrows
    * Fixed Bug #4240 "Pie graph - color difference between graph and legend"
    * Fixed Bug #4430 "Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated"
    * Fixed Bug #4876 "mis-type in code -> undefined property"
    * Bugs fixed/Features added in Image_Canvas
        * Added Request #4451 "Unable to define IMAGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_FONT_PATH outside of Config.php"
        * Fixed Bug #4484 "SVG output problem with fill and alignment attributes of text"
        * Fixed Bug #4586 "Content type image/jpg does not recognized by IE"

Version 0.4.0-alpha [2005-May-24] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
    * Added support for antialiasing images when using GD (both using native GD method and Image_Graph own implementation)
    * Added possibility to specify horizontal title alignment (left, right or center)
    * Fixed an "off-by-one" problem with secondary axis
    * Included all on-line examples in package
    * Removed some memory leaks as described in bug #3958 "Memory leaks in Image_Graph 0.3.0-alpha"

Version 0.3.0-alpha [2005-Feb-25] - Jesper Veggerby <pear.nosey@veggerby.dk>
    * Added possibility to use arrays of the type $data[$id] = array('x' => $x, 'y' => $y) for easy data addition to a dataset
    * Added use of 'null' y-values in line plots (normal and smoothed) causing a break in the line (instead of dropping to zero)
    * Added possibility to make one legend use multiple plotareas
    * Added grouping to drivers (currently only fully supported by SVG driver)
    * Added axis padding (padding inside the plotarea)
    * Added Image_Graph_Axis::setFixedSize() to allow for alignment of axis on different plotareas when in a layout
    * Added possibility to use padding with overlayed legends to make legend _not_ display fx. on-top of y-axis
    * Added/improved support for multi line text using GD drivers
    * Added support for antialiasing images when using GD (GD built in method)
    * Implemented simple shadows (and removed shadow images from distribution)

    * Added possibility to invert axis direction, fx. minimum at top or bottom
    * Added methods to handle axis label customization (Image_Graph_Axis::setLabelOption() and Image_Graph_Axis::setLabelOptions())
    * Minor change to the way GD driver(s) calculate height (so that fx. x-axis labels appear printed on the same baseline)
    * Fixed axis so that forceMinimum() works with axis intersection
    * Fixed PDF (PDFlib) driver to display images correctly
    * Fixed factory method class name alias 'vector', tried to create Image_Graph_Dataset_Vector instead of Image_Graph_Dataset_VectorFunction

    * Added fontmapping in GD drivers useful for mapping mnemonic fontnames, i.e. Times New Roman to font file names (either partial or full)
    * Added configuration option in Config.php (IMAGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_FONT_PATH) enabling to specify default search path for system fonts
        - On Windows systems this defaults to %SYSTEMROOT%\Fonts\
    * Added 'auto' split on layouts - calculated automatically based on actual sizes of the parts (supported only with titles)
    * Added visual tests - not PHPUnit, test cases:
        - Basic testing if requirements are met (GD + Freetype)
        - Testcases for testing drivers
        - Plot tests
        - Axis tests
    * Added support for setting width on the bars in a bar chart
    * Added setFontColor(), setFontSize(), setFontAngle() to elements for easy change of properties of propagating fonts, without needing to create a new object
    * Added new setTitle() method to axis to allow for easier displaying of axis titles
    * Added Image_Graph_Plot_CandleStick to display financial charts for the stock market
    * Added Image_Graph_Plot_Band

    * Added Image_Graph_Tool class with static function for bezier curve-smoothing for drivers without native support (fx. GD)
    * Added Image_Graph_Axis::setAxisIntersection() to specify a value for which the axis intersects another axis (i.e. Y-axis intersects X-axis in x=1 instead of x=0)
    * Implemented drivers to support different output formats
        - Currently full GD (JPEG/PNG/GIF/WBMP), SVG and PDF (PDFlib) support

        - Drivers planned SVG (XML_SVG), PDF (File_PDF) and SWF (libswf)
        - No BC breaking API changes
        - Currently no support for animations, i.e. SVG and SWF
    * Re-implemented support for line styles
    * Fonts now propagate through the structure, meaning if you set a font on the Graph all other elements inherit this font (but can be overridden)
        - This does *not* break BC
    * Modified Image_Graph_Axis_Radar to be a category axis
    * Modified Image_Graph_Dataset to allow for y-value to be an array of values (to support candlestick diagrams)

    * Changed logging behaviour (added Image_Graph::setLog() method)
    * Changed while-list-each to foreach for performance reasons (minor)
    * Changed Image_Graph_Title constructor slightly (second parameter, see Docs. for details)

        - Image_Graph_Fill now inherits from Image_Graph_Common (instead of Image_Graph_Element)
        - Removed GLOBAL font variables
    * Fixed problems with Image_Graph_Axis_Radar showing values in wrong order

        - Include files are now named .php instead of .inc
        - File structure changed

    * Axis' are now returned via the Plotarea::getAxis() method
    * Add methods now return a reference to the object, instead of the 'odd' way of creating global variables, i.e.:
            $Graph->addPlot(new Plot(), 'Plot');
        is changed to:
            $Plot =& $Graph->addPlot(new Plot());
    * Coloring scheme changed so that named colors are now linked to a 24 bit integer value instead of the objects. setFillColor, setLineColor, setBorderColor and setBackgroundColor instead of the corresponding -Style, to use the named colors). The colors are named according to the PEAR naming scheme: IMAGE_GRAPH_[COLOR], fx  IMAGE_GRAPH_RED
